def calculate_price_percentage(percentage_changes):
    """
    This function is used by a shop to add percentage increases to the price of an item.
    The function will take a list of price increases/decreases as an argument and return the final price as a percentage of the total.

    For example, if a price had a 10% discount from multi-buy and a 15% discount from another offer, then your function would be invoked with a list containing -10 and -15. These would be taken off the original price (100%) returning a final value of 75 (representing 75% of the original).

    Use the built-in sum function to work out the modified percentage.
